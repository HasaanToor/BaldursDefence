# Baldur's Defense
Baldur's Defense is a tower defense game inspired by the world of Baldur's Gate 3. Set in the iconic city of Baldur's Gate, players must defend against hordes of enemies seeking to invade the city. Drawing from the diverse cast of characters, creatures, and environments of Baldur's Gate 3, players will encounter familiar faces and locations as they protect the city. Both of us being fans of Baldur's Gate 3 and tower defense games like Bloons Tower Defense wanted to find a way to combine both aspects into our game.
